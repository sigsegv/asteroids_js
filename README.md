# asteroids_js
Asteroids game in vanilla javascript using Entity+Component pattern.

Mainly an excuse to practice the Javascript coding style/patterns as described in Douglas Crockford's [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb)

Need to click on the window to pass focus to the game currently, at least in Chrome.
